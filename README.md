# Welcome to the Rainfocus Front-End Developer Assessment for Peter Mueller

The Main branch will allow you to view my source code. Just navigate in to the 'src' folder to view my code. The files to view are as follows:

+App.js
+PageHeading.js
+OrgSettings.js
+App.css

The images folder also includes images I pulled from the Figma file but they are very interesting.
